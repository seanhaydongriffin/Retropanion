    <h3>Edit the Boot Config of your RetroPie<br>
    </h3>
    The boot config of your RetroPie controls many hardware settings
    including HDMI (display) settings.<br>
    <br>
    If you are experiencing issues with your display, or wish to
    optimise it's configuration, then this feature will help you.<br>
    <br>
    The following are some common reasons for editing the boot config:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>To fix HDMI audio issues on computer monitors</li>
      <li>To remove black borders from the picture</li>
      <li>To force a particular picture resolution / console size</li>
      <li>To improve / boost HDMI signal detection</li>
      <li>To improve support on televisions</li>
      <li>To fix certain issues on 4K UHD televisions<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    To edit your RetroPie boot config perform the following steps.<br>
    <br>
    In the <b>Retropanion - Main </b>window<b> </b>click on the <b>Config</b>
    tab, and then the <b>Edit the Boot Config </b>button.&nbsp; The
    Boot Config window will display.<br>
    <br>
    In the <b>Retropanion - Boot Config </b>window, view and edit the
    settings using your mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; See Appendix XXX for
    details on each setting.<br>

    <h3>Scan the Video Modes for your displays<br>
    </h3>
    Video modes are a critical part of the gaming experience on the
    RetroPie.&nbsp; When the correct video modes are assigned to the
    emulators on the RetroPie games will perform well.&nbsp; If video
    modes are not properly assigned then games will perform poorly and
    can even become unplayable.<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately, every display that you connect to your RetroPie will
    (most likely) support a different set of video modes.&nbsp; The
    RetroPie is (currently) only capable of configuring the video modes
    for one display at a time.&nbsp; Therefore the situation can arise
    where you configure the RetroPie to play games perfectly on one
    display (ie. your computer monitor) only to find that when you plug
    it into another display (ie. your television) the same games fail.<br>
    <br>
    Retropanion addresses this issue by capturing the video modes of all
    your displays, so you can later assign those correctly to the
    emulators you play.<br>
    <br>
    Begin by adding your first display to Retropanion.&nbsp; In the <b>Retropanion
      - Main </b>window<b> </b>click on the <b>Add a new Display
      Device </b>button.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    In the <b>Add a new Display </b>window enter a name to describe
    this display (ie. "Office Monitor", "Family TV", "Samsung TV" etc)
    and click the <b>OK </b>button.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The name of this display should now appear in the <b>Display </b>field
    of the <b>Retropanion - Main </b>window.<br>
    <br>
    Before proceeding you should ensure this display is connected to
    your RetroPie, and your RetroPie is fully booted to the main
    EmulationStation screen.<br>
    <br>
    Next, scan the video modes for this display by clicking the <b>Scan
      all Video Modes </b>button.&nbsp; Retropanion will now scan your
    display for all of the video modes present.&nbsp; If successful a
    list of all the Video Modes and Resolutions will display in the same
    window ...<br>
    <br>
    Repeat the steps above for all other displays you use with your
    RetroPie.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3><a name="configure_emulators_games"></a>Configure the Emulator
      and Game assignments<br>
    </h3>
    For best results the games on your RetroPie should be assigned to
    the emulators that perform the best for each game.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Also the emulators themselves should be assigned to the best video
    mode to suit each emulator.&nbsp; And the video modes themselves can
    vary depending on which display you have connected to you RetroPie
    at any time.<br>
    <br>
    Maintaining all these variables (games linked to emulators linked to
    video modes linked to displays) can be extremely difficult and time
    consuming on the RetroPie itself.&nbsp; Retropanion aims to simplify
    this process.<br>
    <br>
    To check and / or adjust the configuration for emulators, video
    modes and game combinations, first start by selecting the System you
    wish to configure in the System field on the <b>Retropanion - Main
    </b>window...<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Now select the display that you have connected to your RetroPie in
    the <b>Display </b>field of the <b>Retropanion - Main </b>window<i>
      (s</i><i>ee xxx above for steps on how to create displays in
      Retropanion) ...</i><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Next, click on the <b>Config</b> tab, and then the <b>Reload from
      RetroPie </b>button.<br>
    <br>
    Retropanion will now retrieve all the configuration from your
    RetroPie and display, and compare this with the best configurations
    found on the Wiki.<br>
    <br>
    If the video modes detected do not align with the Wiki you will be
    prompted to fix this as follows ...<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    If you click <b>OK </b>Retropanion will match the (optimal) video
    modes from the Wiki with your display and save those changes to your
    RetroPie.&nbsp; The result will be a list of emulators and assigned
    video modes, plus a list of games and assigned emulators ...<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    If you click <b>Cancel </b>then no changes will be made to your
    RetroPie, and the existing configuration of emulators, video modes
    and games will be displayed instead.<br>
